I'm a 4th year PhD student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities studying applied mathematics.  My PhD advisor is [Prof. Gilad Lerman](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~lerman/). I also work closely with [Prof. Joe Kileel](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jkileel/). I earned an my masters degree in mathematics in 2024 and I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and another B.S. in Computer Science at University of Minnesota in 2022 with high distinction and *summa cum laude* honors. My undergraduate thesis was advised by Prof. Gilad Lerman, [Dr. Bryan Poling](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-poling-2622a680/), and [Mr. Craig Poling](https://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-poling-a542234b). 


My research interests include 3D computer vision, machine learning, and optimzation. I'm specifically interested in developing robust structure from motion algorithms using higher order measurements like trifocal tensors and quadrifocal tensors. This extends all current structure from motion frameworks, which are based on pair-wise measurements (fundamental/essential matrices). I'm also interested in developing deep learning based structure from motion algorithms, which can unify the entire pipeline. My work extensively uses 3D computer vision techniques, tensor decompositions, and optimization.
